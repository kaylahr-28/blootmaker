    <h1>Bloot Maker</h1>
    <p>Meet Bloot, a raindrop-shaped creature with a charm attached to its stem. Use this application to customize your
        very own Bloot!</p>

    <h3> Genre</h3>
    <p>This experience is focused on avatar creation. </p>

    <h3>Platform</h3>
    <p>Desktop web</p>

    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>There is no deep narrative to this experience, just a fun avatar creator!</p>

    <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
    <p>This experience is meant to be cute and lighthearted. I plan to make my own assets for Bloot and its customizable
        options, and if I have time
        then for arrows, background decoration and other controls.</p>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>There will be options for changing Bloot's body color, charm, eye shape, mouth shape, and arm shape. Each
        category has predetermined options based on the assets I draw. (If I can find a way to allow user to choose a
        specific hex code for color, I'll do that instead) There will be select options for the user to choose from for
        each category. Bloot can be given a name via user input or randomized adjective. Once Bloot is saved, it will
        be shown again on screen with a button to go back to home page, in which previously saved Bloots will now
        appear.
    </p>

    <h3>Mockup</h3>

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>I used a w3schools.com tutorial for the color picker. <a
            href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_colorpicker.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_colorpicker.asp</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>
    <p>I started planning this project with a mockup sketch. I created three divs to represent the three "pages" of the
        application. First, I coded the buttons and associated Javascript to allow the user to navigate through the
        pages. Next, I added the select options for each category to a flexbox in the customization page and set their
        respective values. I then made the assets for Bloot and added them to my media folder. I also created a Bloot
        class that receives parameters for the same features as the select option catergories. I coded more Javascript
        so that whenever a select option value was changed, the current Bloot instance's values would also be updated
        and displayed accordingly. I also began adding a color scheme and testing out different fonts to use for the
        application. </p>

    <p>I made a div on the complete page to show the final version of Bloot, along with its name. I then moved on to the
        more difficult feature of displaying previous Bloots on the home page once the user returns there from the
        complete page. I started off with getting just one to work, creating multiple methods in the Bloot class that
        would allow for the values of the current Bloot's parameters to be displayed like they are on the complete page.
        After getting one Bloot to display on the home page, I adjusted the methods so that they received div
        parameters. This allowed for me to create and add multiple divs, each one of a previously created Bloot, to the
        larger div that holds all previous Bloots. After getting that to work, I then added the name property for each
        Bloot and made it display on hover. Finally, I added some sound effects on the start/save/back to home buttons,
        as well as a button to toggle background music, which is displayed regardless of what page the user is on.</p>

    <p>I have met and expectations by taking care for the design and interaction of this application. Not only does the
        design reflect the intended aesthetics of the application, it also provides the user with a very
        straight-forward experience so that anyone can follow along without help. My use of an original character with
        distinguishible features helps enhance the creativity of my application. The background sounds allow the user to
        be immersed in the experience. I think I also went beyond expectations by including a feature to display all
        previously made characters on the home page. Users can enjoy watching their collection of characters grow as
        they continue using their creativity to design more of them.</p>
